# Phase_2-Project

For this project, the README.md file should contain:

Overview

Business and Data Understanding
(Explain your stakeholder audience here)

Modeling

Regression Results

Conclusion (Recommendations)

Just like in Phase 1, the README.md file should be the bridge between your non technical presentation and the Jupyter Notebook. It should not contain the code used to develop your analysis, but should provide a more in-depth explanation of your methodology and analysis than what is described in your presentation slides.
